        <div class="parrafo"><p>SFORZA is a rapidly growing live-streaming platform that encourages Creators to express themselves freely and
            produce outstanding content suitable for a thoughtful and mature audience. At Kick, we value the importance of
            constructive dialogue over knee-jerk reactions often associated with 'cancel culture'. Still, we also firmly
            recognize that free speech should not be a shield for hate speech. <br>
            <br>
            Instead of blanket punitive measures that may foster resentment or additional disruptive behaviors, we believe
            in a reformative approach that involves working collaboratively with our Creators. We engage in open discussions
            about their actions, intent, and potential remediation to foster elevated standards, respect, and trust within
            our community. Our focus is long-term solutions that address root issues and promote positive change. <br>
            <br>
            Some Creators may be too loud, annoying, or even offensive to your tastes. In such instances, we encourage you
            to exercise your agency by navigating away from their links and exploring alternative categories and Creator
            styles. Simultaneously, as a Creator, it's vital to focus on your unique style and areas of expertise without
            attempting to impose your preferences on others or weaponize communities against each other. Our goal at Kick is
            to foster an atmosphere of enjoyment and mutual respect. <br>
            <br>    
            We aspire for all users to discover or even create their own distinct Kick communities, contributing to the
            growth and evolution of the live-streaming space. Just as television supplanted radio and video-on-demand
            services superseded the cable box, we at Kick believe that live-streaming represents the future of consumed
            media. In essence, you, the viewers and Creators, are actively shaping Kick's future through your engagement,
            debates, content creation, learning experiences, and, above all, your respect for diverse perspectives and
            lifestyles. <br>
            <br>
            At Kick, we prioritize privacy and safety for all members, regardless of their community affiliation. That's why
            we've made the 'Report' button accessible to every Creator, Moderator, User, and Lurker. This feature empowers
            you to actively contribute to maintaining Kick's secure and respectful environment by reporting any behavior
            that violates policy or compromises user safety. If you encounter a user engaging in harassment, hate speech, or
            other conduct that goes against our community guidelines, please don't hesitate to use the 'Report' button. Your
            reports are vital in alerting our moderation team to address such issues promptly. We take all reports seriously
            and investigate them thoroughly to ensure that Kick remains a welcoming and secure platform for all.<br>
            <br>
            Each Kick community has its unique vibe and set of community rules. Please respect and adhere to the rules of
            the communities you choose to join and avoid disrupting the communities of others. Channel moderators are
            responsible for ensuring a positive atmosphere; if someone's behavior appears disruptive, they may ask that
            individual to leave. We understand that such situations can be frustrating. If you find yourself in this
            position, we kindly request that you take a moment to reflect on your actions rather than harass the community
            that asked you to leave. It's an opportunity to keep the communities respectful and enjoyable. <br>
            <br>
            Occasionally, Kick can get rowdy, reflecting the lively and spontaneous nature of our live-streaming community.
            If you insist on having total control over your environment at all times, you will likely have a tough time on
            Kick. We believe in fostering an environment where everyone can freely express themselves while respecting
            others. We're committed to ensuring a safe and enjoyable experience for all, and we value your input in this
            journey together. As a new platform, we anticipate changing our guidelines based on your feedback and our
            collective efforts to maintain a respectful, diverse, and dynamic community. <br>
            <br>
            Please review our Guidelines below. These apply to the audio, vision, visual imagery, comments, GIFs and all
            other forms of content and communication which may be consumed from viewing or streaming on our platform. They
            apply to everyone on Kick and are diligently enforced by our dedicated Staff Moderators. <br>
            <br>
            Guideline 1
            Pornography
            There is no pornography allowed on Kick. Kick prohibits the creation or sharing of any pornographic material.
            Users must refrain from displaying, linking to or promoting pornographic material on our platform or engaging in
            any activity that offers sexual content including for the exchange of money or gifted items.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Guideline 2
            Violence and Hate-speech
            There is no violence or hate-speech allowed on Kick. We are committed to fostering a diverse and respectful
            community. We strictly prohibit unwanted and intentional violence and we do not allow our platform to be used
            for hate-speech. Encouraging or participating in violence or bullying others under the guise of "just joking" or
            "free speech" is counterproductive to the mission of Kick. <br>
            <br>
            Creators and chatters who engage in or promote violence or hate-based speech through slurs or recognized
            hate-speech language will face enforcement actions. <br>
            <br>
            Violence: can occur in a variety of ways. It may or may not include the use of weapons but often leads to injury
            or harm. Dangerous competitions, dares or pranks can lead to violence. <br>
            <br>
            Strictly no illegal violence against animals will be tolerated. Videos displaying legal hunting practices are
            permitted. However, graphic, close-up and gruesome displays of suffering are not allowed.<br>
            <br>
            Hate speech: We understand context is critical in determining the occurrence of hate-speech. We consider
            hate-speech to be any commentary without context which directly or indirectly negatively targets an individual
            or demographic group with threats of violence or statements of hate. <br>
            <br>
            Encouraging or inciting others to participate in acts that may cause harm. <br>
            Abuse and/or discussion around wanting to harm others.<br>
            Engaging in brigading, hate-hosting, or weaponizing your chat or community against another community.
            Promoting or spreading hate speech or discrimination related to gender, gender identity, sexual orientation,
            ethnicity, skin colour, religious beliefs, immigration status, disability, age, socio-economic status or any
            other demographic identifier. <br>
            Engaging in cyberbullying, doxxing, or harassment of individuals or groups based on personal characteristics or
            beliefs. <br>
            <br>
            Guideline 3 <br>
            <br>
            False Sensationalism <br>
            There is no false sensationalism allowed on Kick. At Kick, we value diversity of thought and believe in open
            dialogue. Users may encounter content and viewpoints that differ from their beliefs or morals. It is essential
            to recognize that diverse perspectives contribute to the richness of our community. We do not tolerate the
            misuse of content or manipulation to harm others' reputations or deceive the community. <br>
            <br>
            Engaging in activities such as selectively editing clips, taking conversations out of context, or crafting
            misleading headlines to create a false narrative will face enforcement actions. Clips used in a good-natured
            manner, such as for humor or memes, will not be subject to enforcement. Enforcement will be applied when clips
            are used to promote hate raids or advance harmful agendas. <br>
            <br>
            Actions that are considered violations include, but are not limited to: <br>
            <br>
            Editing content to present a false narrative, including the use of deep fake or AI-generated content.
            Creating clip headlines that inaccurately depict the events that occurred, with the intention of click-baiting.
            Failing to provide the full context in a clip when presenting it to your audience.
            Blatantly sensationalised information presented as fact with the aim of influencing others..
            Instead of resorting to misleading tactics, we recommend engaging in civil discussions to understand each
            others' points of view better. Open dialogue can lead to constructive conversations and mutual understanding
            among diverse community members. <br>
            <br>
            Guideline 4 <br>
            <br>
            Doxxing <br>
            <br>
            At Kick, we prioritize the safety and privacy of our community members. We strictly prohibit any form of doxxing
            that involves revealing personal, identifiable or confidential information without the user's or creator's
            explicit permission. This includes, but is not limited to, addresses, bank account details, family information,
            places of work, or any other private information the release of which has not been consented to. Engaging in
            this behavior severely violates this guideline and will result in enforcement actions. <br>
            <br>
            Additionally, we do not tolerate Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks or swatting. DDOS attacks involve
            overwhelming a user's or creator's online presence with excessive traffic, disrupting their ability to use the
            platform. Swatting is the dangerous act of making false emergency calls to law enforcement, leading to
            potentially life-threatening situations for the targeted individual. <br>
            <br>
            These harmful activities violate our community guidelines and may have legal consequences. We strongly condemn
            such actions and will take strict enforcement measures against those who engage in them. Please be aware that in
            cases of illegal activities such as doxxing, DDOS attacks, or swatting, we will cooperate fully with law
            enforcement to ensure the safety and security of our community. <br>
            <br>
            Guideline 5 <br>
            <br>
            Botting <br>
            <br>
            Do not bot or inflate metrics. Using bots or artificially inflating metrics is strictly prohibited on Kick.
            Activities such as botting, view botting, follow-for-follow schemes, and subscriber fraud are prohibited. These
            rules are in place to uphold the integrity of our platform and its community and will be enforced accordingly. <br>
            <br>
            Engaging in such activities risks denying your application to the Kick Creator Incentive Program and disrupts
            the genuine interaction between Creators and their audience. <br>
            <br>
            Guideline 6 <br>
            <br>
            Fraud and Deception <br>
            <br>
            Users must refrain from copyright, spamming, solicitation, impersonation, unwanted usernames, restricted content
            and must always ensure they comply with the law in their jurisdiction. <br>
            <br>
            Respect Copyrights. Do not use or air content that you did not directly create or do not have the rights to use.
            We strictly adhere to all DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act) regulations, and if you use copyrighted
            content, you may be asked via chat to remove the content. Prompt compliance will help you avoid enforcement
            action and further information is available in the Kick DMCA Policy. <br>
            <br>
            No Spam or Solicitation. Avoid spamming solicitations in chat, as this disrupts the experience for others. We
            have a zero-tolerance policy of soliciting communities for unwanted services and will take enforcement actions
            as necessary. <br>
            <br>
            Impersonation. Impersonating another user or account is strictly prohibited. Any impersonated accounts will be
            removed to maintain the authenticity of our community. We consider these accounts valid if the impersonated
            creator sanctions a waiting room. <br>
            <br>
            
            Guideline 7 <br>
            <br>
            Compliant channels <br>
            <br>
            Keeping your channel clean and compliant. <br>
            <br>
            Properly Label Your Stream. Ensure your stream is accurately labelled, and refrain from using any codewords or
            titles that promote hate speech or offensive content. <br>
            <br>
            Political Content Compliance. While we allow discussions and opinions on political topics, any involvement in
            illegal activities, promotion of violent or illegal agendas, incitement of violence, or endorsement of unlawful
            methods to bypass laws is strictly prohibited. Such actions will result in enforcement action and cooperation
            with relevant law enforcement authorities. <br>
            <br>
            Appropriate categorization. Ensure streams are in the correct category to accurately reflect the nature of
            content being streamed. <br>
            <br>
            Guideline 8 <br>
            Self-Destructive Behaviour <br>
            We deeply care about the well-being of our community members, which means we must all work together to maintain
            a safe and supportive environment. Promoting "self-harm" in any way, including discussions, images, or actions,
            is strictly prohibited, and such violations will be met with enforcement actions. <br>
